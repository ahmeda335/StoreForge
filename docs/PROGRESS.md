## P1: Foundation (as built)

**What exists**
- Spring Boot 4.0 / Java 21 application, one module so far: `shared` (kernel, OPEN module).
- `RequestIdFilter`: every request gets a validated or generated `X-Request-Id`, in MDC/logs and the response header.
- `ApiExceptionHandler`: all errors are RFC 9457 Problem Details with `code` + `requestId`; unexpected errors become opaque 500s and are logged once at ERROR.
- PostgreSQL 17 with two roles: `storeforge_owner` (Flyway) and `storeforge_app` (runtime DML, 10s statement timeout, 30s idle-in-transaction timeout). Schema `storeforge`. Migration `V1` sets default privileges.
- Actuator on management port 8081: liveness (process only), readiness (process + DB), Prometheus metrics with HTTP histograms and Hikari pool metrics.
- JSON (ECS) structured logs on stdout including `requestId`, `service.version` and `service.environment`.
- Graceful shutdown (20s per phase), virtual threads enabled.
- Docker: multi-stage image (non-root, layered, JRE-only); Compose with PostgreSQL and an optional `app` profile.
- CI: GitHub Actions, `./mvnw verify` + Docker image build.

**Tests (24)**
- Unit: `RequestIdsTest` (11 cases incl. log-forging inputs), `ModularityTest` (Spring Modulith verification).
- Integration (Testcontainers PostgreSQL, real roles): `DatabaseRolesIT` (runs as app role, cannot DDL [42501], migrations by owner, DB-side timeouts), `ErrorResponseIT` (404 problem format, request-id propagation/replacement, 500 leaks nothing but is logged with the request id), `OperationalEndpointsIT` (liveness excludes DB, readiness includes DB, Prometheus content, actuator not on public port).

**Verified manually** ([experiment write-up](experiments/EXP-001-database-unavailable-p1.md)): DB stopped → readiness 503 in about 3s, liveness 200; DB restarted → readiness UP within about 1s; app started with DB down → exits with code 1 in about 3s; `docker stop` → graceful shutdown logged.

**Known limitations (intentional; see "Not yet")**
- No business modules, no authentication. Every endpoint is a 404 problem.
- No trace IDs in logs yet (OpenTelemetry arrives in P6). The request ID is the only correlation key.
- Actuator health shows details (including exception class names) because it is only on the private management port. Restrict this if the port is ever exposed.
- The CI workflow has not run yet: the repository has no GitHub remote.

**Study before P2:** password hashing (Argon2id/BCrypt, salts, work factors); JWT structure and validation pitfalls (RFC 8725: `alg` pinning, `aud`/`iss`/`exp`); Spring Security filter chain and `SecurityContext`; cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`), CSRF vs. bearer tokens; JPA persistence context basics (JPA is introduced in P2). See [learning map](blueprint/27-learning-map.md).
